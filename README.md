# Decision_Tree_Random_Forest_DataScience_ML_Project: 
For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. I will try to create a model that will help predict this. We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.
